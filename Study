1. Parameters Sent from the Circuit Breaker to RTU (Monitoring Data)

These are the parameters the MCB will continuously or periodically transmit to the RTU for remote monitoring and SCADA visualization:
Electrical Parameters:

    Voltage (V) – Measures the line voltage at the MCB terminals.
    Current (A) – Real-time load current flowing through the breaker.
    Power (kW, kVA, kVAR) – Real, apparent, and reactive power consumption.
    Power Factor (PF) – Indicates efficiency of power usage.
    Frequency (Hz) – System frequency (typically 50Hz or 60Hz).

Breaker Status and Events:

    Breaker Status (ON/OFF/TRIPPED) – Indicates operational state.
    Trip Cause (Overload, Short Circuit, Earth Fault, etc.) – Reason for breaker tripping.
    Number of Operations (Counts) – Number of open/close cycles.
    Trip Event Log – Timestamped history of past trip events.
    Self-Diagnosis/Health Status (Normal/Faulty) – Internal diagnostics report.

Fault & Protection Data:

    Overcurrent Alarm – Indicates if current exceeds a set threshold.
    Short Circuit Detection – Indicates a short-circuit condition.
    Earth Fault Detection – Detects leakage current to ground.
    Thermal Overload Status – Detects overheating conditions.
    Arc Fault Detection – Identifies abnormal arcing conditions.

Communication & Network Parameters:

    Communication Status (Online/Offline) – Confirms MCB’s connectivity to RTU.
    Modbus/IEC 61850 Protocol Status – Verifies communication health.

2. Parameters Used by the Circuit Breaker from Different Devices

These are the parameters the MCB will receive from other devices for protection and control decision-making:
From the Power System (Grid/Transformer/UPS/Busbar):

    Incoming Voltage Level – Helps determine undervoltage or overvoltage protection.
    Current Flow from the Transformer/Feeder – Used for load balancing and protection.
    Power Quality Data (Harmonics, Flicker, Transients, etc.) – Helps in advanced protection schemes.

From Other Circuit Breakers or Protection Relays (Interlocks & Coordination):

    Upstream Breaker Status – Prevents unnecessary tripping if an upstream breaker has already disconnected a fault.
    Downstream Breaker Status – Helps in cascading trip coordination.
    Load Shedding Commands – MCB may be signaled to trip in case of grid instability.

From SCADA/RTU Control System:

    Trip or Reset Commands – Allows remote operation from SCADA.
    Threshold Adjustments – Updates overcurrent, earth fault, and thermal limits remotely.
    Mode Selection (Auto/Manual/Protection Mode) – Determines breaker behavior under different conditions.
